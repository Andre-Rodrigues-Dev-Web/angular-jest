# Testing an Angular application with Jest

## Setup

There are excellent tutorials out there (just think of https://timdeschryver.dev/blog/integrate-jest-into-an-angular-application-and-library), but for some reason, most of them are broken at one point or another. 
Usually they work for older Angular version, but not for the current version of Angular and Jest.

So simply take one of the official example projects as a starting point: https://github.com/thymikee/jest-preset-angular/tree/master/examples
